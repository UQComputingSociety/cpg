    "This week's focus is on a very important skill: searching. You may be wondering why we have decided to split the week 4 and week 5 topics of searching and sorting respectively rather than keep them together. The answer is because both of these skills, in particular sorting but searching as well, are extremely dense and it is better if we hone each of these skills individually before incorporating them together.\n",
