# CPG 2022

This semester (semester 2), we'll be starting from scratch in **Python**, working our way up from the basics of competitive programming to more advanced algorithms and data structures.

Sessions will be held every week on Wednesday afternoons from 4:30pm - 6pm starting from week 3, and we will try and go through a different topic every week (see schedule below). The intention is to dedicate 30 minutes to learning about the topic, and then 60 minutes to a mini CPG competition, which is a chance for you to work in a team (if you'd like!) and get some experience applying the algorithms and techniques yourself. Bonus: there will be prizes to be won!

## Resources

The primary resource we'll be using is the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/), but there are a couple of other ones you can use:

| Resource                                        | Purpose                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) | Contains a massive set of problems sorted by topic. We'll slowly go through these topics and problems over the weeks. |
| [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)       | Contains problems as well, but we'll mostly be using this for our mini CPG competitions.                              |
