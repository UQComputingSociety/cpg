# CPG 2022

This year we'll be starting from scratch in **Python**, working our way up from the basics of competitive programming to more advanced algorithms and data structures.

We'll also be hosting our own mini CPG competitions semi-regularly to revise the algorithms and techniques we've learnt and to practice/get used to competition format. (bonus: there are prizes to be won!)

## Resources

The primary resources we'll use are listed below.

| Resource                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) | Contains a massive set of problems sorted by topic. We'll slowly go through these topics and problems over the weeks.    |
| [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/)             | Great place to look if you are confused about a topic or problem. Contains some solutions too, but not always in Python. |
| [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)       | Contains problems as well, but we'll mostly be using this for our mini CPG competitions.                                 |
