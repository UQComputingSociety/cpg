    "\n",
    "Greedy algorithms are a paradigm in which an algorithm always chooses the locally optimal solution, with the logic being this will always lead to the globally optimal solution. Because of this, greedy algorithms generally work in linear time; O(n) (usually) and is a very efficient algorithm paradigm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember! Greedy algorithms are based on the constraint that the locally optimal solution is included in the globally optimal solution; this is sometimes not the case. A greedy algorithm will always give you a solution, but proving that it is the globally optimal solution is difficult. We won't have this problem today, but it is important to keep in mind when selecting this paradigm for a solution.\n",
