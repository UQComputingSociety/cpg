# UQCS Competitive Programming Group

The aim of this group is to get practice with programming questions such as those found on LeetCode, and to apply to this skills to programming competitions such as Google CodeJam, Advent of Code, Google Kickstart and (potentially) team-based competitions such as the International Collegiate Programming Contest (or ICPC). We aim to meet on a **weekly basis** to discuss and work together on challenging and interesting programming problems, and get some valuable experience for technical interviews along the way!

The plan is to work through **three** problems every week: one easy, one medium and one hard difficulty. We will start with simple algorithms based on simple data structures anyone with CSSE1001-level programming experience should be familiar with (such as lists and dictionaries). As time goes on, we will progress to more advanced programming techniques, and some of the sessions will briefly introduce these techniques.

## Week 1: Beginnings

We will work through the following problems:

**Easy: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)** :large_blue_circle:

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Medium: [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)** :red_circle:

> Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

**Hard: [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)** :black_circle:

> There are two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`. You may assume `nums1` and `nums2` cannot be both empty.
