# CPG 2023

Welcome to CPG 2023!

Last year in semester 2, we presented material every week and held mini-competitions. This year, we'll be switching things up and trying something different. We won't be presenting material every week - instead, we'll be bringing along a couple of interesting problems every week to work on!

Feel free to work on anything you'd like - the idea is for this to be a time every week to get some practice and/or help with programming questions, and to discuss them with other people.

We want to foucs on joining some ANZAC competitions this year, so we'll announce when those are coming up as well.

Sessions will be held every week on Wednesday afternoons from 4pm - 5pm starting from week 7. Any notes we go through or slides we present will be added to this repository.

| [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/)             | Curated source of problems sorted by difficulty. Difficulties are based on the US competitions.                    |
| [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) | Problems sorted by topic. These assume some competitive programming background and tend to be more difficult.      |
