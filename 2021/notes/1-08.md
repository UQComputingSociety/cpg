# Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason, greedy algorithms are usually very efficient.

Usually, when using a greedy algorithm, there is a *value function* that determines which choice is considered most optimal. For example, we often want to maximize or minimize a certain quantity, so we take the largest or smallest possible value in the next step.

## Notes

There are a lot of examples in this text, so I'm not going to rewrite notes that are probably worse...
